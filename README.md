# Monogram

This is an experiment in syntax design. In the same way that JSON and XML are
simply concrete syntaxes for generic tree-like structures, Monogram is intended 
to play the same role for generic program-like structures. I was inspired to
see if I could develop something interesting by looking yet-another weak and
domain specific programming language shoehorned into XML (and looking hideous).
