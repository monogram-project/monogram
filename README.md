# Monogram

This is an experiment in syntax design. In the same way that JSON and XML are
simply concrete syntaxes for generic tree-like structures, Monogram is intended 
to play the same role for generic program-like structures. I was inspired to
see if I could develop something interesting after yet-another encounter with
an application that embeds a DSL in XML - with unreadable results.
